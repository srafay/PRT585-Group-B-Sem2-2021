# Week 3 of Software Engineering Practice 2021
This is week 03 of the Software Engineering Practice. For this week, following tasks are completed:


**Create a Web API with ASP.NET Core:**
- Create a web API project.
- Add a model class and a database context.
- Scaffold a controller with CRUD methods.
- Configure routing, URL paths, and return values.
- Call the web API with Postman.

**Call an ASP.NET Core web API with JavaScript:**
- Call an ASP.NET Core web API with JavaScript, using the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API "Fetch API - Mozilla Developer Network Docs")

**ASP.NET Core web API documentation with Swagger / OpenAPI:**
- Swagger (OpenAPI) is a language-agnostic specification for describing REST APIs.
- It allows both computers and humans to understand the capabilities of a REST API without direct access to the source code.
- Its main goals are to:
    * Minimize the amount of work needed to connect decoupled services.
    * Reduce the amount of time needed to accurately document a service.
