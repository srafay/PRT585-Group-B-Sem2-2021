# Week 08 of Software Engineering Practice 2021
This is week 08 of the Software Engineering Practice. For this week, following tasks are completed:


**Implement exception handling and logging:**
- Add Exceptionless or ELMAH to the dotnetcore application.
- Configure error emails to go to a folder (instead of sending to an email).
	+ Later we can configure the same logs to go to an email when we setup SMTP server.
- Error logs must be stored in the database.
